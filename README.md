# snake
Simple cli ASCII snake game, written in a boring afternoon with C and ncurses.

### Installation
Compile with `make`. Ncurses is required, if you are on Debian/Ubuntu install it with `apt install libncurses-dev`. On other Linux distributions and macOS it should be installed by default. The game works well on Windows 10 CU with WSL.

To install the game in /usr/local/bin use `make install`. Depending on your system, root privileges may be required.
